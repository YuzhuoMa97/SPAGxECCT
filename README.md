## SPAGxECCT introduction
SPAGxECCT is a a G×E analysis framework which is applicable to a wide variety of complex traits with intricate structures (e.g. time-to-event and ordinal categorical, binary, quantitative, and longitudinal traits). In the paper **A scalable and accurate framework for large-scale genome-wide gene-environment interaction analysis and its application to time-to-event and ordinal categorical traits (to be updated)**, we applied SPAGxECCT to analyze time-to-event traits in UB Biobank. As a universal analysis framework, we also evaluated the performance of SPAGxECCT in ordinal categorical, binary, and quantitative trait analysis.  

**Summary statistics of time-to-event traits in UK Biobank is available here.**
